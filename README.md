Architecture
Throughout this project, I used various types of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) built with Angular. Express HTML allowed for a straightforward structure to create static pages, which was beneficial for the initial layout and navigation. However, as the project grew, it became clear that a more dynamic approach was needed, which is where JavaScript and Angular came in. JavaScript enabled interactive client-side functionalities, while Angular, as a framework for SPAs, provided a seamless, responsive experience. The SPA architecture allowed us to load the webpage once and then dynamically update content as needed, enhancing user experience and performance.

On the backend, we used a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDB's flexibility with data storage allowed us to store complex and varying data structures without predefined schemas, making it easier to accommodate changes and support JSON-based communication. This choice was also beneficial in handling large amounts of data with fast read/write operations, making it well-suited for a travel application with evolving user and trip data.

Functionality
JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, differs from JavaScript in that it's a lightweight data-interchange format that’s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON serves as the "bridge" between the frontend and backend in our application, enabling seamless data exchange. This format is especially important when sending data to and from the server, as it maintains compatibility across different parts of the stack.

Throughout the development process, I frequently refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. One example was consolidating reusable UI components, such as buttons, input forms, and modals, which helped streamline the user experience and reduce redundant code. This approach increased maintainability, as updates could be made to the component once and reflected across the application. This modularity ultimately made the codebase cleaner and more scalable.

Testing
In a full stack application, testing methods, endpoints, and security requires careful consideration. API testing was essential to ensure reliable communication between the frontend and backend. I conducted various types of API tests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, to confirm that data could be accurately retrieved, created, updated, and deleted as expected.

Security testing added complexity, particularly with the introduction of authentication mechanisms. I used authentication tokens to secure endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users could access sensitive data and admin functionality. This layered approach to security reinforced the integrity of the system, making it more robust and better protected against unauthorized access.

Reflection
This course has been instrumental in helping me achieve my professional goals. I’ve gained a comprehensive understanding of full stack web development, which is invaluable as I pursue a career in software development. The skills I learned and practiced—ranging from implementing a NoSQL database with MongoDB to building a secure SPA with Angular and Express—have not only enhanced my technical expertise but also made me a more competitive candidate in the job market.

Moreover, the focus on building secure, scalable, and maintainable applications has taught me industry-standard practices that will help me continue growing in this field. Overall, this project has equipped me with the confidence and capability to tackle complex full stack applications, positioning me well for future roles in web and software development.
